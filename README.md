# amazon_scrapper

#### Basic scrapper that is based on python3 & uses bs4 along with lxml parser.

## STEPS:

1. Clone the repo and **cd** to it

2. Install the following module **bs4** & **lxml** using pip

```
pip3 install bs4 lxml
```

3. Once you have installed the above module, you can execute the file and follow the instruction on terminal.

```
python3 amazon_scrapper.py
```

## NOTE: It gives 503 when I repeatedly parse, which it should depending on how amazon allow me to parse.
## I have attached a screencast for same. I request you to consider all the possible scenarios.
